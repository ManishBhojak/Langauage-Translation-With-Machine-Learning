# Langauage-Translation-With-Machine-Learning


This project demonstrates a deep learning model that translates text from English to Hindi using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an attention mechanism. It is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras inside a Jupyter Notebook.

## 📝 About

This repository contains a complete implementation of an English-to-Hindi neural machine translation (NMT) system. The model is trained on parallel corpora and utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with attention to generate high-quality translations.

## 🚀 Features

* Translates English sentences to Hindi
* Sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention mechanism
* Custom tokenizer for preprocessing
* Evaluation with sample input/output sentences
* Implemented entirely in a Jupyter Notebook
